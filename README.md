# Satsang Smruti Website
Satsang Smruti is a satsang-feed (*"satsang version of a newsfeed"*) generated currently using articles, posts, and videos from the BAPS website, YouTube, and Medium. It provides an easy and convenient way of knowing about and accessing new satsang content on a regular basis. This website also provides the convenience of displaying a summary of the content and the ability to access it directly through this website.

This website was created by starting off with the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project.

##### Currently, the website can be accessed at: [Satsang Smruti](https://satsang-smruti.uc.r.appspot.com/)
